# MFA-Group
Adds new users to MFA Group to enroll in MFA by connecting to the AzAccount, Defining variables for the createddatetime, Targetgroupname, azure users, user, user id and group id. 
When a new user is created, the user is thrown in the new user MFA group to have the settings enabled to allow a user to edit and add their devices manually themselves, 
Then after 3 days they are taken out of the group. If they still do not have MFA, IT security reaches out to verify everything is going ok
